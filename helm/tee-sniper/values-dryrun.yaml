# Dry run values file for testing tee-sniper

# Use this to test your deployment without making actual bookings:
#   helm install tee-sniper-test ./helm/tee-sniper -f values-dryrun.yaml

# The job will:
# - Log into the booking site
# - Search for available tee times
# - Select a time slot
# - Log what would be booked (but not actually book)
# - Skip sending SMS notification

# Run every 5 minutes for testing (adjust as needed)
